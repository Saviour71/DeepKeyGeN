Introduction 

The increasing use of medical imaging in diagnosis and treatment plans necessitates the protection of sensitive patient information within these images. Leakage of medical images can have severe privacy implications for patients and legal ramifications for hospitals. Cryptographic techniques, like stream ciphers, are employed to secure medical images during storage and transmission. However, designing a secure stream cipher generator to produce random and unpredictable sequences is a challenge. Existing approaches often involve manually designed private key generators, which can be time-consuming, expensive, and require adjustments to achieve the desired security level.
	This project proposes DeepKeyGen, a novel deep learning-based method for private key generation, specifically designed for medical image encryption. DeepKeyGen leverages the concept of image-to-image translation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Stream ciphers are popular for medical image encryption due to their speed, low error expansion, and better synchronization compared to block ciphers. However, designing a secure stream cipher generator is a challenge. Traditional methods rely on manually designed generators, like linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) or chaotic systems. These methods require manual adjustments during the design and implementation phases to achieve a specific security level. This process is time-consuming, expensive, and may not always achieve the optimal performance.
	DeepKeyGen addresses the limitations of traditional methods by proposing a deep learning approach to private key generation. It utilizes GANs, a type of deep learning architecture consisting of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator's goal is to produce data (in this case, private keys) that resemble the target data distribution (the desired key style). The discriminator aims to distinguish between real data (actual private keys) and the data generated by the generator. Through an iterative training process, the generator and discriminator compete, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic private keys, and the discriminator becoming better at identifying forgeries.
